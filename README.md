## Overview

Console-Collection is a console-based game where the player must complete a collection of random objects by performing a limited number of daily actions. The game is built around the unpredictability of the collected items, making each session unique and entertaining.

The gameplay is based on three main actions:

- **Search**: Explore to discover new objects.
- **Wait**: Let time pass and see what happens.
- **Trade**: Exchange items to obtain specific ones.

The project is developed in **TypeScript** and compiled into a Windows executable (`.exe`).

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js (for development), compiled into `.exe` for the final version
- **Interface**: Command-line (cmd)
